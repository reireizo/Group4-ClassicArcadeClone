# GaIMUnityTemplate
Standard template for Unity projects with some basic features (Unity gitignore, GitLFS, etc.)
To use this template, click the "Use this template" button at the top of the page to create a new repository on GitHub.  Then you can clone, pull, or otherwise use the repository as needed. If you are starting a new project, I'd suggest cloning this repository to your computer in your desired location, then creating your new Unity project in that folder.

# Readme for Project
This was a project where I and three other people needed to make a simple clone of a classic arcade game. It was the first project of my Game Production class involving group work.
My (Nathan Irwin) specific role in the group was the coder. I handled the creation of the actual game, learning how to use Unity through online tutorials. All programming was handled by me (Nathan Irwin). This includes but is not limited to:
- Player Movement and Collision
- Enemy Movement and Behavior
- Pellets and Power Up
- Moving to a New Stage Upon Eating All Pellets
- Menu Screens

If there is something I wish I could have done for this project, it was the implementation of sound. The game only has music. I also wish I had learned how to carry over score between scenes.
